        <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> To comply with applicable laws and regulations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. User-Generated Visual Content</h2>
    <p>If WoW GPT allows you to create or modify visual content, we store this content on our servers to provide the service.

        <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may use third-party service providers (e.g., hosting, analytics) who have access to your data only to perform services on our behalf. These providers are contractually obligated to protect your information.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong>  We may disclose information if required by law or legal process.</li>
