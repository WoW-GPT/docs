## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Do I need to set my recipes for each server that I'm on?
Yes.  Because a server usually signifies a guild, your recipe data is stored per server.  This allows the same Discord account to have recipes for multiple factions and WoW servers!

#### How are new recipes added to the app?
I've added the recipes that my guild and I regularly use and am adding new ones regularly.  If you want me to add new recipes, leave a response on this Google Form: <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfH2Jm-jeN89_lrcyDUp2zZL9S_YSyaEstQzcEgTQl-yv_nZw/viewform?usp=dialog"></a>.  Note: the bot also has a button with a link to the same form.

#### I've got another question or issue, how do I contact you?
There's a support Discord for any additional questions and concerns.  Join here: <a href="https://discord.gg/MCauqfP9Qg">https://discord.gg/MCauqfP9Qg</a>
